                        CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require

                        privacy policy. The law&rsquo;s reach stretches well
                        beyond California to require a person or company in the
                        United States (and conceivable the world) that operates
                        websites collecting personally identifiable information
                        from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy
                        policy on its website stating exactly the information
